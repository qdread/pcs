# pcs
## A data package for analyzing aggregated rider data from [procyclingstats.com](https://procyclingstats.com)

`pcs` contains the complete race results from both men and women riders ranked within the top 200 in the PCS Individual Rankings (since 08/29/2020). New rider data will be added as rankings change from week to week.

### Installation

```
devtools::install_github("seanhardison1/pcs")
```

### Usage

#### Biographical information
- `pcs::rider_profiles_men`
- `pcs::rider_profiles_women`

#### Race results
- `pcs::rider_records_men`
- `pcs::rider_records_women`

Rider results are returned as a `tibble` with the column `result` indicating finishing place. When a rider is listed as DNF, DNS, or DSQ etc, their 
results are encoded numerically as follows:

| Result flag | Code |
|-------------|------|
| DNF         | 999  |
| DNS         | 998  |
| OTL         | 997  |
| DF          | 996  |
| NQ          | 995  |
| DSQ         | 994  |
  
### Convert from CSV to sqlite 
In case you want to work with SQL instead of CSV, it can be converted. The only dependency is the sqlite3 CLI program itself and it needs to be on the $PATH for the script to work. These functions are not available in the built package, so you will need to clone the repository to use them.

To do so: cd to the `scripts` dir and execute `csv_to_sqlite`, it should generate two .sqlite files  
* `data/rider_records_men.sqlite`
* `data/rider_records_women.sqlite`
